            Annoying & Self-Indulgent Reflections On The Year 2010
        </h2>
        
        <div class="post-content-preview">
            
                Again, I know this is self-indulgent, but it’s still relatively new in the year (I actually started writing this more than a month ago).  Here are some of my personal reflections for the year 2010:

Best Things About 2010:


  Overall, this was a year of wonderful happenings, especially in the second half of this past year.  After a string of pretty depressing years, 2009 got better and 2010 was absolutely great.  I’m very thankful for so many wonderful sights, sounds, and happenings this past year.
  I was surrounded by so many incredible people this year.  A big thank you goes to all these people.
  Enjoyment of completely loving what I do on an everyday basis.  Actually looking forward to going into work and working with incredible people who have been so much fun to be around, both in the US and in France.  A year of amazing professional contacts and meetings and discussions.
  So much wonderful travel this past year.  Many miracles in making connections and meeting great people while traveling.  Receiving help from numerous strangers while traveling.
  Financial support and travel funding from numerous fellowships.
  Made proud little steps towards betterment: saving money, diligent schedules of athletic workouts, research, and writing, got rid of some clutter in my life.  Lots of running and miles logged in this last year.
  Having a really incredible family who is so much fun to be with.  Becoming an uncle again!
  Becoming better at letting go of things that are out of my control.
  Treasuring so much good healthy food in this past year.
  I was able to see so much great music, movies, and art museums this past year.


Worst Things About 2010 (all minor things in the grand scope of wonderfulness that was 2010):


  The frequent reminder that I have wasted my time and energy on people and projects not worth my time and energy.
  Cracking a tooth on a tiny rock in a pizza crust.
  Two incidents of my stuff getting stolen.
  Annoying tea party propaganda and the over conservatism of the USA.  The hopelessness of the administration of hope.
  Too many grant proposals rejected.
  The ONLY bad things about living in France: Cigarette smoke in unavoidable public places, too much dog shit on the sidewalks, and no concept of waiting in lines.
  Too much useless, worthless, and ego-driven online communication in cyberspace.  The ever increasing loss of digital privacy.  The prevalence of misinformation spread on the internet taken as fact and the people who refuse to research, question, and search for the truth.
  Too little time for art and sleeping.
  Too many people communicating who don’t know the difference between YOUR and YOU’RE; THERE, THEIR, and THEY’RE; and AFFECT &amp; EFFECT, among others.


Well, there you have it.

UPDATE: I have been informed by a loving, respected, and faithful reader that the end of this post is a real downer, and I not only respect this person’s opinion very much, I agree with this sentiment, so I want to BOLDLY reiterate that the year of 2010 was incredible and wonderful.  The negative final points - this is me mainly just venting about certain frustrations - are not in any way, shape, or form, reflective of the whole of 2010.  Here’s to an even more incredible 2011!

        <div class="post-content-preview">
            
                It’s about time I posted this.  Here’s my annual list of music I enjoyed this past year.  I know I have forgotten tons of records or have yet to realize just how great some of these recordings are.  Just as I am writing this, I went to pull something to listen to and came across the great Woods At Echo Lake LP (on Woodsist) which came out this year and which I totally forgot to put on this list.  I just need to stop revising and procrastinating and post this list.  There’s also plenty of music which came out this past year I am still discovering.  I gave up in vain when I tried to sort out all the compilations and reissues I have listened to this year.  This list has come about from many nights sipping coffee and whiskey while spinning records.  So, fuck it, without further ado, here’s my favorite music of 2010:

It’s been a rough few months for musicians departing us.  I feel bad that I have never had a chance to tell you of my fondness for Captain Beefheart, who unfortunately passed on a few weeks ago.  Now, the news of Trish Keenan passing (here and here and here) has hit me pretty hard since Broadcast (wiki and blog) are up there on my ultimate favorites.  Apparently she contracted an aggressive strain of the H1N1 influenza virus during Broadcast’s Australian tour and was never able to recover.  Here’s two videos taken from last year’s Broadcast and The Focus Group collaboration album called Broadcast And The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults Of The Radio Age:

            The Future Sound Of London
        </h2>
        
        <div class="post-content-preview">
            
                I haven’t been counting how many candles we can put on Dubstep’s cake - we’re in the kindergarten years I am assuming? - and however old Dubstep is, it keeps changing and, in my opinion, keeps getting better.  I don’t even know if we can call it Dubstep anymore?  I hate titles anyway, why do we need to put titles on things?  People ask me what kinds of music I listen to: I just listen to music.



Though to use the title, many albums this past year were cut from the Dubstep cloth but might not be strictly labeled as so.  The following releases – all coming from London based artists and some of my favorites of the past year - have been extricated from a post-Burial world, where voices are put before beats, and whether these vocals are comprehensible or not, they are always veiled in deep layers of South London murk.



Darkstar’s North caught me by surprise.  I was already familiar with Darkstar’s first released single “Aidy’s Girl Is A Computer” on Hyperdub so I was expecting an album of the same instrumentals.  It turns out, like designer Will Bankhead’s industrial album cover, this album is not disconnected from a long line of dark post-punk British pop, with surprisingly unadulterated vocals.  If you needed more evidence of the trajectory they are coming from then you should know that they cover Spandau Ballet with the song “Gold”.  In fact, this excellent album is filled with pop songs ensconced in years of post-industrial dust.  I also quite enjoyed chatting with one of the members of the group in Honest Jon’s awesome record shop in Ladbroke Grove this fall.



Splazsh (Honest Jon’s Records) by Actress builds on his previous release Hazyville, continuing to submerge a Basic Channel-esque haze with glitched vocals, puncturing through washes of reverb with Prefuse 73-like staccato syllables disguised as beats.  This release takes a bit of time for the sheer density of sound to soak into your brain, but once it does this one is a real keeper.  It consists of an equal distribution of tracks either for kicking back on the couch or shaking it on the dancefloor.



I have to be honest, I hate writing about music because it’s so difficult to do, but otherwise I don’t know how to tell you about it, so I do it anyway.  You know the quote (see here and here for the derivation) from Martin Mull - “writing about music is like dancing about architecture” - well, that’s basically about how I feel.  I can’t even begin to explain how off-kilter, warped, and brilliant Mount Kimbie’s Crooks &amp; Lovers (Hotflush) is.  Maybe you could try to imagine what it would sound like if Sly &amp; Robbie’s Jamaican drum and bass, the input from two John’s - Cage and his prepared piano and Fahey and his electric guitar, a roller-rink Wurlitzer organ, a bottle of soda water, two galloping horses playing ping-pong, and a broken record player got together for a jam session in a rotating clothes dryer.  Yeah, it sounds that good.



Some of the most exciting music of this past year’s latter half, for me at least, came from a series of EPs released by James Blake.  While not unfathomable, the development of Blake as an artist across these three EPs has simply been staggering.  The Bell Sketch EP, CMYK EP, and the most recent Klavierwerke EP, not to forget numerous remixes, have kept me busy.  If you need statistics to testify, James Blake’s remix of Mount Kimbie’s song “Maybes” was the most listened song in all my playlists in 2010.  The Bell Sketch EP (Hessle Audio) started out this year with three warped noisy dirges disguised as dance songs.  CMYK, the title track from an EP (on R&amp;S) of the same name, with morphed R&amp;B and gospel samples, is the Hyph Mngo of 2010 and undeniably one of the most instantly catchy tracks of the year.  His work culminated in the Klavierwerke EP (R&amp;S) of this fall, hands down one of the best releases of the last year, and one where Blake has started to use his own vocal and piano samples (in an almost sublime tribute to Robert Ashley) to construct his songs instead of taking samples from elsewhere.  Vocals appear like strobe light flashes accenting unknown features but quickly dissipate so that you can’t establish their familiarly.  For me the songs from this EP became the soundtrack to countryside views from trains in motion and these sounds and spaces echoed of half-remembered beats once heard on a dancefloor but replayed through my dreams at night.
