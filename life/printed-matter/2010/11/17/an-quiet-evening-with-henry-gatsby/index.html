<p>Please forgive the break in posts, life has been quite crazy for me right now.  I’ve been visiting a research group in the UK and my days have been packed with meetings and seminars and great food and company.  I have a lot on deck for posting so please check back soon.</p>

<p>After a very nice dinner with my host laboratory last night, I unwound with a pint of Henry’s at Cricketers in So’ton and enjoyed reading an opinion take in one of my favorite newspapers about one of my favorite books. Perhaps you would like to read the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/15/great-gatsby-delusion">article</a> too.  The comments at the end of the article are also an interesting read.</p>
