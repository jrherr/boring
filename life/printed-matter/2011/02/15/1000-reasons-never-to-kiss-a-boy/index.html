<p>I don’t think I have ever won anything by a random drawing before - and I’m not counting the time I was selected to, reluctantly, flip the light switch at my local town’s Christmas Tree lighting ceremony when I was eight years old - so you can imagine my surprise when I was just notified I had won an autographed copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/1000-Reasons-Never-Kiss-Boy/dp/0823420442/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1297789366&amp;sr=1-8"><em>1,000 Reasons Never To Kiss A Boy</em></a> by acclaimed children’s book author <a href="http://marthafreeman.com/">Martha Freeman</a>.</p>

<p>Not only am I very excited to be able to now proclaim that I have actually won something, but I’m also excited about finding out what all these reasons are, and there sure are a lot of them.  Perhaps this will help me to understand my adolescence a little better?  I plan <em>not</em> to show the book to my girl - I’ve obviously provided enough reasons for her not to kiss me, so I don’t need to introduce another 1000 reasons into the mix.  After I have finished my read, in order to spread the love around - people say you should pass a good book on to another librophile - I have an extremely special 9-year-old in mind who would very much appreciate this book as long as her mom and dad say it’s acceptable.</p>
