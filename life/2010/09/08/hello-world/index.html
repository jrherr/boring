<p>Welcome to the blog “If You Find The Earth Boring…” a place for me to communicate things I find interesting.  I’ve attempted to maintain a blog on different blogging sites, but this will be the permanent home.</p>

<p>You may be wondering where the blog title comes from.  It’s from the title of one of my favorite songs from Sun Ra’s Space Is The Place.  It also was appropriated by U.N.K.L.E. for a remix of Portishead.  When I was in college, living in my first apartment outside of the dormitory, I roomed with two other guys from the college radio station.  I came home from class one day to the sounds of June Tyson emanating from my roommate’s room.  That song has been stuck in my head for years now…</p>

<p>I don’t find the Earth boring, and I hope you don’t either.</p>
