<p>The last year was a great year, filled with so much goodness, old and new friends, new places and spaces, great memories all around.  I blinked and the past year passed right in front of me.  I guess my only real complaint is that I wish the world would stop spinning so fast.  Here’s to an amazing 2012! <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/2011/02/04/annoying-self-indulgent-reflections-on-the-year-2010/">As opposed to last year</a>, I’m not listing any of the pros or cons of 2011, but what I am listing here is a list of reminders for the future year and some small things I would like to resolve to do - or at least resolve to do <em>better</em> - this year.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Don’t Forget How Powerful Small Steps Are</strong></p>

<p>I tend to be discouraged by big projects so I need to remind myself to break things down into smaller chunks.  I think this also helps with my sense of accomplishment too - when I have smaller items I complete each day I can celebrate in getting closer to finishing the big project and not be intimidated by it.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Be Positive &amp; Keep It Going</strong></p>

<p>I’ve been told that I am overly optimistic about things, but I know I can do better.  My girl is very positive and her amazing energy rubs off on me too.  I just need to keep looking on the bright side and to avoid getting frustrated when I am deep in a task.I’m making progress and working hard.  I plan to keep up the positive vibes to keep the momentum going.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Fail More and Fail Better</strong></p>

<p>I am trying to embrace failure.  If I’m not failing it means I am not challenging myself and not climbing to the next level, whatever that means.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Drink More Water</strong></p>

<p>I love water.  I should be drinking more of it.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Sit Up Straight</strong></p>

<p>I tend to get a little slouchy in the office chair at work.</p>
