<p>One of the highlights of each month for me is the arrival of <a href="http://www.thewire.co.uk/">The Wire</a> magazine (I’ve had a subscription for more than a decade and a half now) and one of my favorite monthly columns, simply called <a href="http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/epiphanies/">Epiphanies</a> and located in each issue’s back page, is where monthly contributors write about their sonic epiphanies.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/6445/"><img src="images/kenneth-goldsmith-photo-from-wire-magazine11.jpg" alt="" title="kenneth goldsmith photo from wire magazine" /></a> While this month’s copy is undoubtedly waiting for me at home right now, I was able to read this month’s <a href="http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/6445/">Epiphanies column from Kenneth Goldsmith on The Wire’s website</a>.  Kenneth Goldsmith is the founder and curator of the extensive online media library <a href="http://www.ubuweb.com/">UbuWeb</a>.</p>
