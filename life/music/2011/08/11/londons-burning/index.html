<p>You’ve probably read all about the London riots <a href="http://finarecords.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/pias-distribution-goes-up-in-flames/">already</a> (and forgive me if you’ve read this  somewhere else because it’s been making the rounds in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14454359">news</a>), but one of the repercussions has been the burning and destruction of the PIAS (otherwise known as Play It Again Sam) Distribution Warehouse in Enfield, an area with pronounced looting and damage.</p>

<p>Most importantly and unfortunately, the warehouse was the three floored home to the UK’s sole distributor for independent record labels.  The extent of the damage to the warehouse is still not known, but it’s estimated that this was the largest destruction of vinyl records ever, and it looks like there was a total of <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/global/three-arrested-over-sony-warehouse-fire-1005313352.story">25 million discs destroyed</a>.  There could be far-reaching impacts not only to independent music artists and record labels in the UK, but also around the world.</p>
