<p>Many weeks ago I was on the road for a meeting in San Francisco.  In between the long hours of multi-day workshops, what seemed like never-ending presentations, and catching up with friends and colleagues, I took a break by ducking out of the meeting one evening and headed into the mission district to <a href="http://www.aquariusrecords.org/">Aquarius Records</a> and an in-store performance from neo-traditionalist acoustic guitarist Marisa Anderson.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aquariusrecords.org/"><img src="images/aquarius-records.jpg" alt="" title="aquarius records" /></a>Being a former record store owner myself, I know how hard the folks at Aquarius work.  They put together an awesome bi-weekly list of <a href="http://www.aquariusrecords.org/cat/newest.html">new releases</a> with very enthusiastic and detailed reviews of the releases.  These bi-weekly lists (and sometimes weekly themed lists) are <a href="http://www.aquariusrecords.org/cat.html">archived on their website</a>, which you should check out.</p>
