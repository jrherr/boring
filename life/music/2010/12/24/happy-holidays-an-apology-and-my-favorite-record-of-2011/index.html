<p>First, I’d like to wish everyone a warm and happy Holiday and wonderful New Year.</p>

<p>Just a quick post to let you know I haven’t forgotten about you.  I’m sorry, but I’ve had a very busy few weeks, absolutely crazy in fact, and that has kept me from posting.  I’ve got a lot of things in the works, mainly in need of editing, so I hope to get caught up with posts after I am caught up on sleep.  Everyone else is asleep right now, but I’m stuck in another time zone.  I’m also making some changes around here, and will be changing some of the scripts and layout, so please bear with me as I iron out the kinks.</p>

<p>I’m also working on my end of 2010 favorites and a reflection of the past year.  Compiling this list is always one of my favorite things about the start of the New Year and I’m exciting about posting it in the coming weeks…</p>

<p>That being said, I think I may already have picked my favorite album of 2011.  Friends in London sent me an advance of the James Blake LP which is scheduled to be released on February 7th through Atlas/A&amp;M.  I have been taking the album in over the last few days.  Included is the cover of Feist’s <em>Limit To Your Love</em>, which was released as a single a few weeks ago.  This track is probably the most straight-forward on the record.  I’m completely enthralled with James Blake’s work and find it truly alien and innovative yet strangely familiar at the same time.  There has been an amazing development and evolution across his EPs over the last year, and his full length further develops themes established on his <em>Klavierwerke</em> EP released this fall.</p>
