<p>P.S.: I know I haven’t been really great about filling you in on all the action like I promised, but I promise again, I have lots of stuff to tell you about.  The truth is that I have been out of town away at meetings, weddings, or visitings for the past month and really have not yet established myself as an ‘on the road’ blogger, so maybe you can forgive me?</p>
