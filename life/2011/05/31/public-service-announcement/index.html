<p>I know it’s been a while since you’ve heard anything substantial from me, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t been busy with this blog.  After a server failure erased everything, I was able to restore from a backup, but I had to resort to plenty of script writing to bring the dead databases back to life.  I have tried to fix any posts that may have been lost since I backed everything up.  You’ll notice that I’ve lost my photos page, which should be back up soon and totally re-vamped from scratch.  All this has happened while I’ve been traveling, so that’s added to the amount of time it’s taken me to get back on track.  I would like to thank you, my faithful readers, for your patience through this quiet time.</p>
