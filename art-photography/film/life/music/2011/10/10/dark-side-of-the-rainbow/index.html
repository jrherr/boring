<p>When I was in college I probably spent more time tirelessly toiling away working at my local record store than I did studying.  Once, while I was working, I was approached by a fellow student wanting to interview me.  He was writing an article for the college newspaper on the synchronicity of music and video.</p>

<p>The first question he asked was how I felt about watching <em>The Wizard Of Oz</em> while Pink Floyd’s <em>Dark Side Of The Moon</em>, which I had never heard of before.  He told me you could push play on the good ‘ole VHS and manually drop the needle on the record player at just the right moment and the two would play in synchronicity.  I answered questions for his article, but I don’t know if I provided any special insight, especially into this phenomenon now known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Side_of_the_Rainbow">Dark Side Of The Rainbow</a>.  I went out and rented <em>The Wizard Of Oz</em> from my local library and tried it for myself.  I don’t know if I did it right.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few years later and there are plenty of resources (<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2104580_synchronize-dark-side-moon-wizard.html">here</a>, <a href="https://home.comcast.net/~davejanelle/floyd.htm">here</a>, and <a href="http://dj-spyder.blogspot.com/2008/12/dark-side-of-rainbow-coincidence.html">here</a>) to help you in your quest for maximum synchronicity.  There are a few lists (<a href="http://members.cox.net/stegokitty/dsotr_pages/definitive_list.htm">here</a>, <a href="http://www.turnmeondeadman.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=25">here</a>, <a href="http://www.everwonder.com/david/wizardofoz/">here</a>, and <a href="http://thepinksync.tripod.com/">here</a>) of all the synchronous events, yet no lists for all the asynchronous events.  See for yourself, you can watch it here now:</p>
