<p>I’ve written about the Vampire Weekend album <em>Contra</em> <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/?p=299">before</a>, so I won’t go on about it, but I’m somewhat fascinated by the drama and subsequent legal case that has arisen from the album cover.  If you’re curious, read a nicely written take on the story from this past summer <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/vampire-weekend-scandal-201008">here</a> and see the photo portfolio <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/vampire-weekend-slide-show-201008#slide=1">here</a>.  The legal verdict is still undecided.</p>
