<p>I’ve been out of town for most of the last three months (first attending the weddings of some friends, then attending a few academic meetings and now contributing five weeks of lectures to a class), but upon returning I had a welcome and wonderful first installment of <a href="http://socialmusicrecords.com/">Social Music’s subscription series</a> (curated and put together by Mike from <a href="http://www.yetipublishing.com/">Yeti Magazine</a>) in my mailbox.</p>

<p><img src="images/Social-Music.jpg" alt="" title="Social Music" />Although I have barely had a chance to listen to them over the last week, the first round of records in the series are Richard Bishop’s (of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_City_Girls">Sun City Girls</a> fame) Graviton Polarity Generator, a compilation of Jamaican Gospel music, the self-titled Cloudcraft album (featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clean">The Clean</a>’s Hamish Kilgour) and a split 7-inch single (with awesome artwork by Portland artist and musician <a href="http://www.e--rock.com/">E*Rock</a>) featuring a side each from New Zealand’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bats">The Bats</a> (always a personal favorite of mine) and Chicago’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Califone">Califone</a>.</p>

<p><img src="images/social-music-records.jpg" alt="" title="social music records" />I also picked up two other records from Social Music that weren’t part of the subscription series: a retrospective of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_June_Brides">The June Brides</a>, one of my most favorite bands ever (got all this stuff but it’s nice to have it all on <em>one</em> record), and Where The Soul Of Man Never Dies, a great white-gospel compilation.</p>
