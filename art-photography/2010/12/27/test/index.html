<p>I’ve gone from being stranded in European snowstorms to being stranded in Mid-Atlantic snowstorms in a matter of days.  I was just forwarded a <a href="http://vimeo.com/18213768">link</a> to Michael Black’s short film by a friend and thought I would post it here.  This video is a great example of stop motion photography and was “filmed” yesterday not far from my current location.  The film consists of a still photo every five minutes over a 20 hour time period.</p>

<p>The above film reminded me of another <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/12/01/high-speed-camera-sh.html">video</a> that was forwarded to me earlier in the year; another great example of stop motion photography.  In this film, Graeme Taylor shot the Bath Spa train station from an Intercity 125 train at 210 frames per second and then assembled the photos into this film.</p>
