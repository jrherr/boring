<p><a href="http://jonrafman.com/">Jon Rafman</a>, an artist from Montreal, has curated a series of <a href="http://maps.google.com/intl/en/help/maps/streetview/#utm_campaign=en&amp;utm_medium=van&amp;utm_source=en-van-na-us-gns-svn">images taken from Google Street View</a> and placed them on his <a href="http://9-eyes.com/">9-Eyes website</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View">9-Eyes being the number of cameras on the Google Street View Car</a>).  I’m absolutely amazed at how the images he has selected accent the extraordinary nature of the everyday view from streets/roads.  I’ve gone through and pulled out 50 of my favorites and placed them here.</p>
