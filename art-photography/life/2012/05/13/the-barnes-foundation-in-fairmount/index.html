<p>When I was younger I had a date with my Mom (Happy Mother’s Day Mom!) to go see the <a href="http://www.barnesfoundation.org/collections/art-collection/">Barnes Foundation Art Collection</a>.  I’ve loved art before and after that day, but I will never forget how much I enjoyed that art exhibition.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.barnesfoundation.org/">Barnes Foundation</a> has a <a href="http://www.barnesfoundation.org/about/campuses/philadelphia/building">new center in Philadelphia</a> – located in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairmount,_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania">Fairmount Neighborhood</a> – close to the <a href="http://www.philamuseum.org/">Philadelphia Museum of Art</a>, the <a href="http://www.rodinmuseum.org/">Rodin Museum</a>, and, I wouldn’t forget, the most beautiful and best thing about the city is in this neighborhood too.</p>

<p>The new Barnes Foundation Building opens this month.  Tom Bugaj shot this amazing time lapse assembly of the new Barnes Foundation building by taking a photo every 30 minutes for two years.</p>
