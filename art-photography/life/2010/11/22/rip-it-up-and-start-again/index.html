<p>I finally have a separate page set up for <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/photos/">photos</a> and images of artwork.  I will still be working on fixing some broken links, etc., but it’s ready to go.  I’ve just posted two new folders, along with some oldies.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/photos/index.php?album=Parapluies">first new folder</a> is partly inspired by rainy days looking out my third story window on the street below and partly inspired by my friend’s work found <a href="http://djbunnyears.posterous.com/">here</a>.  There’s also a nice focus of Eric’s <a href="http://www.contributormagazine.com/623.php">work</a> in Contributor Magazine this month.</p>

<p><a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/?attachment_id=331"><img src="images/2.jpg" alt="" title="2" /></a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/photos/index.php?album=Rip+It+Up+And+Start+Again">second new folder</a> is me playing around.  I hope you enjoy.</p>

<p>Busting out with the updates today since the server is back up and running after a couple of days of downtime.  There’s more on the way so please check back soon.</p>
