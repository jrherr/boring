<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Giorno">John Giorno</a>â€™s <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/ecstaticalphabets/works/dial-a-poem/">Dial-A-Poem</a> from 1970 is now <a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/ecstaticalphabets/dial-a-poem/">online at the MoMA website</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Among the first telephonic artworks, <em>Dial-a-Poem</em> allowed the public to access an archive of recordings of work by contemporary poets; by calling a local telephone number, participants could hear a well-known poet like John Ashbery or Allen Ginsberg recite a short poem selected at random by a primitive answering machine system.</p>
