<p>I’m really fascinated by both architecture and sculpture, and these structures, commissioned by former Yugoslavian president Josip Broz Tito in the 1960s and 70s, certainly fit into both categories.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_World_War_II_monuments_and_memorials">These structures were constructed for a variety of reasons</a> – to commemorate WWII battle sites (Tjentište, Kozara, &amp; Kadinjača), places where concentration camps were located (Jasenovac &amp; Niš), or places that the government wanted to supplant its agenda.  Into later decades these structures were not maintained, which has led some of them to a state of abandon (and <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/2012/06/19/abandoned-disneyland/">which I also have a fascination with</a>).  If you’d like to read more: visit <a href="http://www.cracktwo.com/2011/04/25-abandoned-soviet-monuments-that-look.html">here</a>.</p>
