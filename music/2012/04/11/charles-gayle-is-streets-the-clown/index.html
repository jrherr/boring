<p>I’ve seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gayle">Charles Gayle</a> perform numerous times in both solo and group settings.  He never ceases to amaze me as a performer.  He’s had an amazing life which he sometimes alludes to in lengthy spoken word monologues during his solo performances.  Charles Gayle can often be found busking in New York City under his “Streets The Clown” persona.</p>

<p>The Wire Magazine has a feature on him this month (<a href="http://www.thewire.co.uk/issues/338/">April 2012</a>).  You can also find an <a href="http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/537/">article from 1994</a> in the magazine’s archives about him and here’s a <a href="http://vimeo.com/38851398">video</a> of his street busking in New York.</p>
