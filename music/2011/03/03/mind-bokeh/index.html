<p>Thanks to the generous and always on the ball peoples over at <a href="http://warp.net/">Warp Records</a>, I have been enjoying the new Bibio album <a href="http://warp.net/records/releases/bibio/mind-bokeh">Mind Bokeh</a> which will be released March 29th.  I’ve been a Bibio fan for years and  I was so excited by the title of this new album I got myself in gear and re-worked some of my own bokehs from a past holiday (see <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/?p=610">here</a>).  Now I’m enjoying the further expansion of Bibio’s oeuvre with another fine album that has been sinking into my head for the last week or so.  He’s moving in some drastically different directions since his fine debut <a href="http://www.mushrecords.com/release/68"><em>Fi</em></a> in 2005.  Mind Bokeh is going to be one of my favorites of this year for sure.</p>
