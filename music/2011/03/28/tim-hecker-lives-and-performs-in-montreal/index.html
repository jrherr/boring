<p>There’s already been a lot of great new music this year, but one of my favorite records has been <a href="http://www.kranky.net/artists/heckert.html">Tim Hecker</a>’s <a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/discog/krank154.html"><em>Ravedeath 1972</em></a> album, on Chicago’s <a href="http://www.kranky.net/">Kranky record label</a>.  All of Hecker’s records are equally beautiful and sinister, perhaps appropriately, his new album was recorded in a church in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavik</a> using the church pipe organ as the only source material (and also notable for contributions from fellow dark ambient sound sculptor <a href="http://www.ethermachines.com/">Ben Frost</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kranky.net/artists/heckert.html"><img src="images/tim-hecker-live-in-montreal11.jpg" alt="" title="tim hecker live in montreal" /></a>Last summer, I had a quick academic meeting in Montreal and was able to take my girl for a few days with me.  We had both been to Montreal a few times, but this particular whirl-wind visit was great and one of the highlights was having a (very generous) tapas dinner at <a href="http://www.casadelpopolo.com/contents/node/25">La Sala Rosa</a>, in the public house part which is located downstairs from the venue where the above performance was recorded.</p>

<p>We had an equally delicious meal at the <a href="http://www.casadelpopolo.com/contents/node/128">Casa Del Popolo</a> vegetarian café and music venue across the street from <a href="http://www.casadelpopolo.com/contents/node/25">La Sala Rosa</a>/<a href="http://www.casadelpopolo.com/contents/node/20">La Sala Rossa</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.casadelpopolo.com/contents/node/25"><img src="images/sala-across-the-street11.jpg" alt="" title="sala across the street" /></a>All the restaurants and venues are run by the awesome <a href="http://www.casadelpopolo.com/contents/node/74">Suoni Per Il Popolo</a> collective who also put out great music on their record label and sponsored the show where this live recording was made.</p>
