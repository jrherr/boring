<p>I’m back from a week-long getaway and have many things to tell you about and update you on.  Since it’s March 14th here’s a video about the musicality of Pi (get it?, 3.14159…) from Portland musician and all around nice guy Michael John Blake.  His video was <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/03/14/134492882/how-to-transform-the-number-pi-into-a-song">featured on NPR’s morning edition</a> today.</p>
