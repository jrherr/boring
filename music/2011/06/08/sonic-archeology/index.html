<p>The original way to record and playback sounds were “records” – as they were called back then – wax cylinders.  These tubes of wax could be etched with a sound recording and then be played back repeatedly.  Their use was from the late 1880’s until they were stopped from production in 1929.  The introduction of the phonograph record in the 1910’s did away with wax cylinders.</p>
