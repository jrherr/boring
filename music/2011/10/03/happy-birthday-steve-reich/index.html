<p>When I started working at my college radio station, I was 18 years old and getting into Jazz and other “out” music.  Thankfully, a veteran DJ – one who was a faculty member at the University and who had hosted a radio show for years – took me under his wing.  He passed many records my way – and he lent me actual LP records – and to this day, that’s the main way I listen to music.</p>

<p>One memorable pile he let me borrow, if I remember correctly, included a couple of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCoy_Tyner">McCoy Tyner</a> records, Cecil Taylor’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_Structures"><em>Unit Structures</em></a>, and John Coltrane’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ship"><em>Sun Ship</em></a>.  That pile in particular was a lot more memorable than other piles, because it had a record I never got around to listening to: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Reich">Steve Reich’s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_for_18_Musicians"><em>Music For 18 Musicians</em></a> (on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECM_Records">Manfred Eicher’s</a> <a href="http://www.ecmrecords.com/Startseite/startseite.php">ECM record label</a>, a label I already mentioned <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/?p=183">here</a>).  When I returned the records to him, I admitted to not listening to it and he scolded me and told me it was my major loss.</p>
