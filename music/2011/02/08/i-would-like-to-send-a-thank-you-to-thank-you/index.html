<p>I’ve been enjoying the new <a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/artists/?id=11346">Thank You</a> album <a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/catalog/index.html?id=105170">Golden Worry</a> on the fine <a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/index.html">Thrill Jockey</a> record label.  This album nicely compliments the band’s last album (2008’s <a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/catalog/index.html?id=102497">Terrible Two</a>) and formidably rocks out - without ever over rocking out - and is weird enough to keep my attention through multiple listens today.  There are some fine things happening in Baltimore right now.  Just thought I would let you know.</p>
