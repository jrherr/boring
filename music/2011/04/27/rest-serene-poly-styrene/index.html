<p>For better or worse, I’ve always associated the Slits with X-Ray Spex, maybe because I discovered both bands about the same time way back.  I’m very saddened to think we’ve lost both <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/?p=194">Ari Up</a> and Poly Styrene (read <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13193968">here</a>, <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/cultural-capital/2011/04/ray-spex-singer-poly-styrene">here</a>, and a great interview with her <a href="http://www.state.ie/27458-features/interview-with-poly-styrene">here</a>) to cancer in the span of one year.  Gonna give Germ Free Adolescents a few spins when I get home.</p>
