<p><a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/?attachment_id=702"><img src="images/Booking-Bands.jpg" alt="" title="Booking Bands" /></a>I used to work in a record store where, in the community bathroom, there was a poster board with a list of band names merged with book titles, other band names, corporations and business names, etc.</p>

<p>Looks like someone else had the same idea to extensively collect a list of merged band names and book titles in their work bathroom.  Then it got turned into a contest outside of work.  Check it out <a href="http://www.coudal.com/bookingbands.php">here</a>.</p>
