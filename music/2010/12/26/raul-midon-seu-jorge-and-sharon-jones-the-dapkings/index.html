<p>This show seems like ages ago, but I don’t want to miss out on the chance to tell you about a great performance I saw in Nancy’s Parc de la Pepiniere (I’ve mentioned this park before <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/?p=352">here</a>).  This night of music was aligned with Nancy’s huge Jazz Pulsations festival.  This show included Raul Midon, Seu Jorge performing with his backing band Almaz, and lastly, the amazing Sharon Jones &amp; The Dapkings.<a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/?attachment_id=426"><img src="images/raul-midon.jpg" alt="" title="raul midon" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.raulmidon.com/">Raul Midon</a> started out the night at the park.  Raul was born in New Mexico but has spent most of his life living up and down the eastern seaboard of the United States.  He seems to me to be obviously inspired musically by Stevie Wonder, both musically and spiritually.  Raul Midon is a consummate song writer - the song takes precedence above all.  Here it was just him and his guitar, so his songwriting showed through quite well, especially in this intimate in a live setting.  He was quite impressive tonight in support of his newest record <a href="http://www.raulmidon.com/albums/synthesis"><em>Synthesis</em></a>.<a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/?attachment_id=427"><img src="images/seu-jorge.jpg" alt="" title="seu jorge" /></a></p>

<p>Seu Jorge &amp; his band Almaz performed after Raul Midon.  I was truly excited and surprised by the number of Brazilians here in France showing support.  You probably would recognize Seu Jorge from his movie roles in Wes Anderson’s movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362270/"><em>The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou</em></a> as well as the great Brazilian film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317248/"><em>City Of God</em></a> from 2002.  Seu Jorge &amp; Almaz have a new record out on Egon’s <a href="http://www.nowagainrecords.com/">Now Again Records</a> called <a href="http://www.nowagainrecords.com/seu-jorge-and-almaz-the-model/"><em>The Model</em></a> which you should check out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sharonjonesandthedapkings.com/">Sharon Jones &amp; The Dapkings</a> were the main reason I wanted to see this show.  I skipped on a chance to see them play earlier in the year in the US and had time to regret this decision, so I wanted to take advantage of this show in Nancy.  Sharon Jones always puts on an amazing show; she’s arguably the most energetic performer in the world.  The show was incredible.  The band did a tribute set to great Soul legend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Burke">Solomon Burke</a> who passed away just a few days before this show.  The band also played a bunch of songs from the new album <a href="http://www.sharonjonesandthedapkings.com/index2.html"><em>I Learned The Hard Way</em></a>.</p>
