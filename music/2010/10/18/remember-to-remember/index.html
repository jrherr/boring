<p>Been digging this Neon Indian remix of Au Revoir Simone and thought I would pass it on.  I haven’t heard much from Au Revoir Simone, but this remix - please excuse the expression - is the bees knees.  Somehow manages to meld 1983 with 2103 in 2010. Neon Indian’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_Chasms">Psychic Chasms</a> record was one of my favorites of 2009. This remix has been available for a while, but I avoided checking it out after a Pitchfork <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11495-another-likely-story-neon-indian-remix/">review</a> said it was weak.  I disagree with this review, but you should see for yourself: <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/Another Likely Story (Neon Indian Remix).mp3">Au Revoir Simone - Another Likely Story (Neon Indian Remix)</a></p>
