<p>Just was catching up on the daily news this morning and I am sad to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/arts/music/22ariup.html">report</a> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Up">Ari Up</a>, vocalist for the band The Slits, passed away.  While The Slits record <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_(The_Slits_album)"><em>Cut</em></a> is a classic, I also love her work with the New Age Steppers.   She was a profound influence on punk fashion and one could easily argue that she contributed to shaping the face of modern music.</p>
