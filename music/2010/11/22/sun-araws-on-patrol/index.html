<p>It was a hot Friday night this past summer.  It wasn’t late but I was tired and decided to lay down and read a little bit.  I put a digitized version of the new double LP <em>On Patrol</em> by Sun Araw on the stereo (on repeat!) and started to read.  Did I say it was really hot and humid, you know, the way it sometimes gets in the summertime?</p>

<p>I started to drift away to sleep as I attempted to read.  I wasn’t reading a novel by Philip K. Dick, or was I?  I couldn’t remember what I was reading.  I felt the hot sand of a silver white Hawaiian beach warming my body.  I slowly lifted up my head to see a futuristic crew of what looked like police, ride up on surfboards from white capped waves, wearing outfits stolen from the prop warehouse of the movie <em>Tron</em>.  As these uniformed beings were greeting me, a row of hip-shaking hula-girls sung from a distance, and then a shimmering saucer appeared flying above me in the sky.  A large green hand appeared from the spacecraft and slowly picked me up from the beach and brought me gently inside the apparently metal floating object.  I was placed in a soft lounge chair as a strange green being swayed in the distance playing a looping melody on an electric guitar.  It was wearing dark sunglasses.  Quite calmly, the large green hand plugged a stereo cable into the back of my head and I was filled with the static filled sounds of a broken Hammond organ perfectly matched to the electric guitar played by the strange green being.  The strange green being sang something but I did not understand its meaning.</p>

<p>I heard my phone ring and I slowly sat up in bed.  I looked at the phone, but the call registered “unknown number” with no other information.  I then looked at the time and realized I had listened to <em>On Patrol</em> for the last four hours in my sleep.  It was this night that I realized that this was a fucking great album.</p>
