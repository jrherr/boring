<p><a href="http://www.pavilionfilm.com/"><img src="images/sparkler.gif" alt="" title="sparkler" /></a>I don’t know how I came across this movie, <a href="http://www.pavilionfilm.com/">Pavillion</a>, just a link from a link from a link - I suppose.  I haven’t seen the movie – it’s playing (opening?) right now at the <a href="http://sxsw.com/">SXSW festival</a> – but it looks like one of those melancholic ‘coming of age’ young person reality movies (i.e. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_%28film%29">George Washington</a>, etc.) that I seem to have a soft spot for.</p>

<p>I guess the real reason this movie is notable for me is the movie soundtrack by <a href="http://www.thrilljockey.com/thrill/Sam-Prekop/">Sam Prekop</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_and_Cake">The Sea And Cake</a>.  One afternoon, I had this website open on my browser and the music loop from the website played for about 6 hours straight.  I fell in love with the loop.</p>
