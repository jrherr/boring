<p>Finally had a chance to check out David Fincher’s new (well, relatively new here in France) movie <em>The Social Network</em> last night.  I’ve already mentioned the movie <a href="http://ifyoufindtheearthboring.com/?p=101">previously</a>, so I won’t carry on here.  I am a sucker for a great script and this movie has one.  The film grabs you in the first scene - a scene which basically reverberates through the whole story - and doesn’t let up.</p>

<p>I had grand plans here to write more about the movie, but really, what can I say?  Go see it.</p>

<p>One thing that has been floating through my mind since seeing the movie is the concept of richness.  Some people measure richness as a level of how diverse something is, such as the quantification of biological diversity.  Some people think being rich is having a lot of cash money.  Some people think being rich is having a lot of friends.  Some people think being rich is having the <em>one</em> thing you want.  What do you think?</p>

<p>Also, read or listen to <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2010/11/19/02">this</a>.</p>
