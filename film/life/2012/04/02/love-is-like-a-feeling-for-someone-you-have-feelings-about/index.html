<p>Check out this short film “<a href="http://vimeo.com/33698394">The Love Competition</a>” by <a href="https://store.mcsweeneys.net/t/categories/wholphin">Brent Hoff</a>.  I don’t think there is a way you can watch these 15 minutes and not smile.  Here’s the premise:  “Seven contestants each have 5 minutes in an fMRI machine to love someone as hard as they can. Brain regions involved in producing the neurochemical experience of love are measured. The contestant who generates the most activity in those areas of the brain wins.”</p>
