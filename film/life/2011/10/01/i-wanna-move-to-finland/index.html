<p>Here’s a video (basically a University of Helsinki propaganda video - which is a great University I might add) that really exemplifies the incredible solidarity and socialism held by the Finnish people.  Apart from being a very well produced video, it focuses on the Finnish people’s desire to place social equity, health, education, and sustainability as pillars of society.  People are willing to pay taxes for these things because they know it leads to a better life.</p>

<p>I just don’t understand how some people (I’m talking Tea Party people here, people) in the United States can be so ignorant, especially in striking opposition to the high regard the Finnish place on such things that better society.  Some people in the United States attack “Socialism” like they know what it is.  Others argue that the United States is too diverse and large to achieve the same sort of solidarity as the Finnish, but I can dream, can’t I?</p>
