<p>These short films have been making the rounds so you might have come across them, but they are so well edited I wanted to post them here.Â  The three movies are called: <a href="http://vimeo.com/27246366">Move</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/27244727">Learn</a>, and <a href="http://vimeo.com/27243869">Eat</a>, and they were filmed by three guys who went to 11 countries over the course of 44 days.</p>
