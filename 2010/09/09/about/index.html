<p>This blog is a reflection of my love of music, art, and other culture.  It’s really just a place to post things I find interesting, thought provoking, or just down-right cool.  Also, as a blog should be, it’s a document of events, mishaps, and personal endeavors; sort of a diary of my daily, or not so daily, escapades.</p>

<p>As I have worn many different hats in my career I don’t know what I normally am.  In my current day job I study the biological sciences and blog about that over <a href="http://cymeandcystidium.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and please stay in touch.</p>
